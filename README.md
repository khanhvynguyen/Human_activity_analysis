The objective of this project is to extract time series features for human activity monitoring.

First, I acquired the accelerometer data of all the 15 subjects for 4 activities: walking, running, climbing up and climbing down, from the link: https://www.uni-mannheim.de/dws/research/projects/activity-recognition/#dataset_realworld

Next, I applied **natural and horizontal visibility graph** to the accelerometer time series data

Then, I carried out some **network analysis** such as computing average degree, network diameter, and average path length

Permutation entropy and complexity are also computed
